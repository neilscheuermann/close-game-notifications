# Nail-Biter

Never miss an exciting ending to an NBA game with the help of Nail-Biter!

Nail-Biter watches the scores when you don't have time to, and will send you a text message anytime an NBA game is close with a few minutes left in the 4th quarter. To accomplish this, Nail-Biter runs in the background using cron jobs and a series of functions to fetch data from a live sports data API, then using a communications API to send text messages when it detects a close game.
